# Trello "clone"

## Description
  wanted to to try rsbuild and tanstack router, for some reason the sever crashed randomly, i still don't know why, it might be a problem with rsbuild, other than that pretty fast, also tanstack router is pretty cool, i like the way it works, i might use it in the future.

## Technologies
  - React
  - Tanstack Router
  - rsbuild
  - local storage
  - tailwindcss


The code is not perfect, i just wanted to try the router and rsbuild, i might improve it in the future.

But for now, im working on pixel art editor with qwik
